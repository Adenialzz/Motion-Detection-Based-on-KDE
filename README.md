# Motion-Detection-Based-on-KDE# Motion-Detection-Based-on-Kernel-Density-Estimation
Kernel Density Estimation, DA and ML homework in DHU.

This project is for simple motion detection based on KDE(Kernel Density Estimation).

## kde.py

### parameter mode
You can detect motion in a vedio or in a series of pictures by selecting parameter 'mode'.

### parameter kernel
You can choose a kernel function between gaussian kernel function and epanechnikov kernel function.

## test.py

### usage
This file is used to tune threshold of final binary image quickly.

## result.zip

### content
This compressed file include some of results after running kde.py .

## md_data.zip

### content
This compressed file include some source material that can be used to motion detection.
